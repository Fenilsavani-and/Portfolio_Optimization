# 📊 Hybrid Portfolio Optimization using Deep Learning & Statistical Methods

## 🧠 Executive Summary
This project presents a **hybrid portfolio optimization framework** that integrates **traditional financial theories** with **advanced Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures** to improve risk-adjusted returns under real-world market constraints.  
The research is **peer-reviewed and published at an IEEE International Conference**, validating both its academic rigor and practical applicability.

The model combines **Markowitz-based statistical optimization**, **factor-driven models**, and **deep learning techniques** (LSTM, TCN, Reinforcement Learning-inspired optimization) to dynamically allocate asset weights across varying market regimes such as **bullish, bearish, and inflation-driven environments**.

## 💼 Business Problem
Traditional portfolio optimization techniques (e.g., Mean-Variance Optimization) suffer from:

- High sensitivity to input assumptions  
- Poor performance under non-linear and volatile market conditions  
- Limited adaptability to regime shifts  
- Inefficiency in high-dimensional asset universes  

From a **business and investment perspective**, fund managers require:
- Stable portfolio construction  
- Robust downside risk control  
- Improved Sharpe ratios under real constraints  
- Scalable and explainable optimization frameworks  

This project addresses these challenges by **bridging financial theory with machine learning** to enhance portfolio performance and decision-making.

## ⚙️ Methodology
The project follows a **hybrid, multi-layer optimization approach**:

### 🔹 Traditional Optimization Models
- Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz)
- Treynor–Black Model
- Black–Litterman Model
- Sharpe Ratio Maximization
- Most Diversified Portfolio (MDP)

### 🔹 Deep Learning Framework
- Custom **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** with a finance-aware loss function  
- Sequential models:
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
- Reinforcement Learning–inspired policy updates
- Controlled volatility scaling using **α (alpha)** and **τ (tau)** parameters  

### 🔹 Validation Strategy
- Backtesting under multiple market regimes
- Active vs Passive portfolio comparison
- Risk-adjusted performance evaluation
- Benchmarking against S&P 400 index
